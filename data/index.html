        <h2>Refugees in the U.S. Facing Fear-Filled Rhetoric</h2>
        <h4> by Josh Wilson</h4>
       
       <p1>With the first of the Syrian refugees <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/04/07/first-syrian-refugees-hit-us-soil-as-obama-resettlement-surge-begins/">arriving in the U.S. last month</a>, and about 10,000 more to follow, the U.S. finds itself embroiled in a debate over whether they should be accepting refugees or not. When President Obama announced he would take in 10,000 Syrian refugees, he and his administration received criticism, especially following the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels.</p1>
<br><br>
<p2>Public resistance to refugees coming to the U.S. is nothing new. <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/19/u-s-public-seldom-has-welcomed-refugees-into-country/">According to PewResearch Center</a>, the American public has historically disapproved of refugee resettlement in the country, whether it was the Hungarians in 1958, the Indochinese in the 1970s, or the Cubans in 1980. Since 1975, the U.S. alone has taken in over 3 million refugees, with both Democrat and Republican Presidents in office for some of the largest admissions numbers.</p2>
<br><br>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Refugees Admissions by Region From 1975 Through March 31, 2016</h4>

<br><br>
<p3>With refugees having a long and rich history in the U.S., why do they still face so much push back? Stacie Blake, Director of Government and Community Relations for the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, believes that the hesitation towards welcoming refugees stems from fear of the images we see on TV, such as the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels.
</p3>
<br><br>
<p4>"The rhetoric and the images don't match the reality of our refugee system," Blake said. "[Refugees] are coming every day with no problems and this system has been working for over 30 years." Will Haney, Associate Director for External Relations, Immigration and Refugee Program for Church World Service, also believes that much of the tension toward refugees in the U.S. comes from the recent terrorist attacks in Europe, as well as the current debate playing out through the upcoming presidential election.
</p4>
<br><br>
<p5>
"The anti-immigrant and anti-refugee rhetoric being used by political leaders has shifted public perception of refugees," said Haney. "We need to life the voices of the refugees and understand that they are extremely successful community members."
</p5>
<br><br>

<h4>Where Are Refugees in the U.S. Settling?</h4>

 Both the U.S Committee for Refugees and Immigrants and the Church World Service focus on serving some of the 60 million refugees and displaced persons around the world. Blake expressed concerned when she sees violations of refugee rights, like when they are kept from working or moving freely throughout the country.
<br><br>
"I would like to see the U.S. and other countries take in more refugees," Blake said. "We have strong programs with deep experience in communities, but there are not enough resettlement slots to fulfill the need." The wariness to bring in refugees is puzzling to many, especially considering how thorough the U.S. refugee resettlement program is.
<br><br>
"(The U.S.) has the the most rigorous vetting system in the world," said Blake. "The screening process takes about 1,000 days. Most people have waited about 17 to 20 years since they originally left their country."
<br><br>

      <h4>What Countries Are Refugees in the U.S. Coming From?</h4>

<br><br>
"People want to get involved but the long resettlement process distances them," said Haney. He would like to see a quicker process, citing Norway and Sweden's refugee response systems as being more beneficial and believes that Canada and Germany are "wonderful examples of countries stepping up" during the Syrian refugee crisis.
<br><br>
"Continued advocacy on the ground and sharing refugee success stories helps tackle the anti-refugee rhetoric," Haney added. "But the vast majority of people are welcoming of folks who've come to the US over the years."

Bijay Gurung is a junior at Syracuse University who came to the U.S. with his family in March of 2009. His family and about one-sixth of the Bhutan population was forced out of the country when the Bhutanese Royal Family implemented a "One Nation, One People" policy. This policy was used to expel the Nepali speaking citizens of Bhutan.
<br><br>
Gurung's family was placed in a refugee camp in Nepal in 1993, where he was born nearly two years later. His parents decided that they couldn't see a future for their children while living in a refugee camp, and with repatriation not an option, his family was placed in the Manchester, New Hampshire. Gurung has faced bullying and xenophobia throughout his seven years in the U.S.
<br><br>
"My freshmen year of high school, all of us who came from a refugee camp in Nepal would sit at one table for breakfast and lunch," Gurung said. "Some of the kids who sat next to us would look at us and laugh or throw food and milk at us. Though Gurung and his siblings have learned the English language and quickly adapted to American culture, the transition has not gone as smoothly for his parents.
<br><br>
"My parents had a very difficult time learning the language," he said. As a result, they had a hard time finding jobs. Had it not been for the government's assistance, I think we would have been living in the streets."
<br><br>
Overall, Gurung says that the positives have outweighed the negatives in his family's resettlement in the U.S. After spending the first 13 years of his life in a refugee camp where he wasn't a citizen, Gurung and his family finally have a place that they can call home. On January 28th, 2015, Gurung gained U.S. citizenship and for the first time in his life, he was the citizen of a country.
<br><br>
“I was once a stateless person living in a refugee camp,” he said. Before last year, when someone asked him what country he was a citizen of, Gurung said "I would tell them that I was a citizen of the world.”
